    According to  <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bear.asp' target="_blank">Investopedia</a>, A bear is an investor who believes that a particular security, 
    or the broader market is headed downward and may attempt to profit from a decline in stock prices. Bears are typically pessimistic about the state of a given market 
    or underlying economy.  <br /> <br />
